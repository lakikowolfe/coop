A millenial through and through, I've been using social media since middle school to keep in touch with friends and stay up to date on the latest memes. But, it wasn't until I hopped on Twitter in 2018 that I realized how much data science and research conversation was happening on the platform. For those unfamiliar with Twitter, it is a social media platform where users post and interact with short messages known as 'tweets'. A user can follow profiles and hashtags to customize the tweets that are displayed on their screen. While Twitter is far from a perfect place for in-depth discussion, it remains one of the best tools I have found for real-time updates on community discourse in niche communities. For example, by following hashtags like `#rstats` and people like [Hadley Wickham](https://twitter.com/hadleywickham) or our very own [Kate Hertweck](https://twitter.com/k8hert) I am pushed a stream of R statistics related tweets. I have taken part in hackathons and applied for scholarships that I discovered in a Tweet! I often learn about new R packages and interesting papers through Twitter. And of course, I still stay up to date on the latest memes.

Since I already spend time scrolling I figured I might as well share what I've seen there!
