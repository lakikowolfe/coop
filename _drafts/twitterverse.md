A millenial through and through, I've been using social media since middle school to keep in touch with friends and stay up to date on the latest memes. However, it wasn't until I hopped on Twitter in 2018 that I realized how much awesome data science and research conversation was happening on the platform. While Twitter is far from a perfect place for in-depth discussion, it remains one of the best tools I have found for real-time updates on community discourse in the world of data science and academia. For those unfamiliar with how Twitter works: by following specific people like [Hadley Wickham](https://twitter.com/hadleywickham) or our very own [Kate Hertweck](https://twitter.com/k8hert) and hashtags like `#rstats` and `#medTwitter` I am pushed a stream of tweets that are by these people or relevant to my interests. I have taken part in hackathons and applied for scholarships that I discovered in a Tweet! I often learn about new R packages and interesting papers through Twitter. And of course, I still stay up to date on the latest memes.

Since I already spend time scrolling I figured I might as well share what I've seen here!
